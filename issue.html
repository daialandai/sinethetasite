                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Kristin Chang (張欣明)</b>  is a 19 y.o. Atayal Taiwanese & Han Chinese queer girl living in California and New York. Her work has been published or is forthcoming in The Margins (Asian American Writers Workshop), the Shade Journal, Nailed Magazine, Muzzle, and elsewhere. Her debut chapbook "Past Lives, Future Bodies" is forthcoming from Black Lawrence Press in 2018. She can be found at kristinchang.com and on Twitter @KXinming.</li>

                        <li><b>Emily Chen (谌月) </b>is a high school senior from San Jose, California. As editor-in-chief of her school’s literature and arts magazine, a varsity public forum debater, and a budding film enthusiast, she enjoys working in interactive humanities disciplines. Things that make her happy: neuroscience, Ghibli movies, and black sesame ice cream. Someday, she would like to visit the places and meet the people she reads and writes about.</li>

                        <li><b>Evelyn Chua (蔡依玲) </b>is a sophomore studying graphic design. While Canada is her home, her heart resides in Malaysia. She finds inspiration from many sources from her Chinese-Malaysian heritage to the nooks and crannies within downtown Vancouver. When not playing with shapes, line and colour, she’ll be hopelessly composing music at her keyboard.</li>

                        <li><b>Alan Dai (戴瑞祥)</b>, age 18, is a student from Boulder, Colorado by way of Albany, New York (his parents are from Jiangxi and Shanxi in China). He is a 2016 alumni of the Iowa Young Writers Studio, and enjoys writing about angsty boys and angstier men.

                        <li><b>Elaine Hsu (徐子文) </b>(b. 1997) is an artist from the Bay Area, currently residing in Chicago as a student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Working predominantly in fiber, illustration, and installation, Elaine investigates the playful, yet disparaging, relationship between the inviting and grotesque that appears in the reflection of childhood memories. This contrast between good and bad spans subject matter throughout her work such as the intimacies of relationships, traces of identity, dreams, and personal memory. Ultimately, her work highlights the beauty and fun, or lack thereof, that exists in everyday life. </li>

                        <li><b>Kevin KaiJie Huang (黄凯捷) </b>is a Chinese transgender boy who lives in California. He sees himself as a work in progress and is an amateur photographer (@kevinkaiphotography on Instagram). He recently graduated high school and was an editor for his school's yearbook.

He will attend the University of California of Los Angeles starting in September.</li>

                        <li><b>Jiaqi Kang (亢嘉琪) </b>is a seventeen-year-old from Geneva, Switzerland with heritage from Shanxi province, China. When not studying for the IB, she enjoys burning her tongue on tea and discussing complex theories that she only half-understands. An aspiring curator, she hopes to study history of art at university. </li>

                        <li><b>Kirstin Wu Latimer (吳言卮)</b> is a Taiwanese-British poet from London. Her work has been published in ASH magazine, and she won the Dart Prize of the Martin Starkie awards for poetry (2016). She is an alumna of the Winter Tangerine Summer 2016 workshop, and is currently studying for an undergraduate degree at Oxford University in between campaigning, messy scribbling and surviving. </li>

                        <li><b>Kat Nham 任嘵盈</b>, (she/they) is a Chinese-Vietnamese American womxn born to a Chinese Vietnamese refugee and a Hong Kong immigrant. They are currently studying Asian American & Asian Diaspora Studies and American Studies at UC Berkeley. Her writing has always been her way of understanding and honoring all of the identities she holds and the ancestors who brought her here.</li>


                        <li>Having moved to Canada at the age of two, <b>Chris Qiu (邱浩燃)</b>, is soon beginning his degree in architecture at the University of Waterloo. After four years of being uprooted from his Chinese heritage in high school, he hopes to reconnect and have it become an integral part of his life and work. During his spare time, he likes to play piano, dabble in street photography, and contemplate music until 3 am.</li>

                        <li><b>Elisabeth Siegel (朱明慧)</b> is a biracial freshman at Yale College studying global affairs. A writer, photographer, and designer, she hails from San Jose, CA and is frankly done with all this snow. She does publicity and design work for multiple organizations on campus.

                        <li><b>Juliette Wu (伍家荟)</b>  is a Chinese-American who resides in the port city of Shenzhen, Guangdong and studies at an
                        international school. She has had formal artistic training and creates large-scale,
                        approximately 50 x 50 pen-and-ink works both recreationally and for school.
